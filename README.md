PCB Making at Home

### Welcome to my Home PCB Fabrication page

##### There's actually not much here, just:
- Some simple SMD soldering guides 
- The file **agitador - 2T.gcode** which, if sent to your 3D printer, will heat and shake the table to speed up ferric chloride etching. 
- The folder **MÃ©todo UV** has notes on how to make a simple but effective PCB exposer with an *UV Nail Lamp Dryer*.

#### Then, where's the good stuff about PCB Making?
Hold on, mate! It's right here:
